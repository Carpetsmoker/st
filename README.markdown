This is my configuration of [`st`](https://st.suckless.org/). I did not write
most of this, this is simply a convenience repository to track my configuration
and patches.

Also see the
[original README](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/st/blob/master/README)
and [FAQ](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/st/blob/master/FAQ).

It it up-to-date with upstream commit
[`096b125`](https://git.suckless.org/st/log/)
(2018-12-11),
which is the most recent version as of December 2018.
I will try to keep things up to date, but no promises. Feel free to open an
issue if it's not. See [the commit
log](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/st/commits/master) for a list of changes.
